  <Title>Automatic Fishing in Walrus Way (Winter Theme)</Title>
  <Description>
The Toon will automatically fish in Walrus Way, The Brrrgh (during the Winter Theme).
Before you click on Start, make sure that
• you are in a quiet district,
• your fish bucket is empty,
• you have enough JellyBeans for 20 casts,
• your toon is standing on the rear left fishing board (viewed from entrance).
